The 19/20 season ended in a disastrous way for Barcelona. The club being knocked out of the champions league in a humiliating way meant that the summer transfer window ahead of them was meant to be crucial in the rebuilding process. The impact of COVID-19 was going to play an important part in the financial resources of the club with the club announcing that they had suffered about 200 million loss in revenue due to the pandemic. Further, the UEFA had restricted the club from making any new signings until they sell some of the players. 

So was the transfer window successful?

To sum it up the transfer window was a huge blowout for the club although the only positives from the window were that Barcelona managed to lower their wage bill and the average age of the squad.

There were many departures from the club. Ivan Rakitic left the club and returned to his previous club Seville who were recently crowned the Europa league champions.

Vidal left the club for Conte’s men in Italy.

Nelson Semedo was sold to Wolves for about 30 million.

Although the most surprising decision was when Luis Suarez was made to leave the club for Atletico Madrid.

So far it seems that Barcelona although got rid of players which meant opportunities for the young generation to make their mark at the club but you would be shocked to know that Barcelona sold Suarez, Rakitic, and Vidal for a combined fee of 1.5 million. Another alarming decision came last year when Barcelona rejected an 80 million bid for Rakitic and then sold him for free the next year.

Now let’s see the arrivals into the club Barcelona were only able to make one significant signing the whole window which was the arrival of Segino dest which meant that the right-back position was about to be strengthened.

The club was heavily linked to various players all window but failed to add any of their targets into their squad.

The primary target was to sign Depay so they could have a proper number 9 at the club after Suarez but the club was unable to afford his 25 million price tag.

Depay’s arrival would have rarely benefited the club as he simply doesn’t possess the necessary qualities to be a successful striker in Barcelona no doubt he’s a great player.

Another main target was to get back their la Masia prodigy Eric Garcia back to replace the veteran Gerald pique but again the club failed to match the asking price of 30 million for the youngster.

Failing to add significant quality to their team meant that the new manager only got one of the desired players into the club.

So far the start of the season has been great under the new manager but things still look shaky at the bottom. Their recent displays showed that the player's work rate on the pitch was significantly improved as looked to attack till the final whistle but the match against Seville certainly brought back bitter memories. The opposition playing a high press caused troubles for Barca who looked sharp than previously still struggling with this high press.

No doubt that the game plan has improved under the new manager but the bigger problem that’ll Barcelona will face is the absence of their veteran players in crucial matches of the season or suffer fatigue due to lack of squad depth.

the positives to take from the first month under the new manager are noticeable, the defensive stability is the biggest one to take from them all as the club has only managed to concede one goal in the first three league games but the biggest test for the club is yet to come as Barcelona face Juventus and Real Madrid in October.

further, after the painful exit in the champions league, a vote of no confidence against the current Barcelona board was initiated which was successful in getting all the signatures needed to sack the board
